# MLGuard for Network Traffic

**MLGuard** is an AI-powered network security system that analyzes network traffic to detect phishing and malicious behavior using machine learning. It features an end-to-end MLOps pipeline with FastAPI, MLflow, MongoDB, AWS S3, Docker, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## What is This Project About?


This project is an AI-powered system that helps detect phishing and suspicious network activity. It uses machine learning models to analyze data from a network (like internet traffic) and tells you if something looks dangerous.

Even if you don't know much about AI, think of it like a smart security guard for your network ‚Äî it learns from past data and keeps an eye on new traffic to catch threats before they cause harm.



##  Key Features

-  **Network Threat Detection** using Machine Learning
-  **FastAPI** with **Swagger UI** for API interaction
-  **MongoDB** for storing raw and processed data
-  **MLflow** for model tracking and metrics logging
-  **AWS S3** for model storage and backup
-  **CSV Output** for predicted results
-  **Dockerized** for easy deployment
-  **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD pipeline
